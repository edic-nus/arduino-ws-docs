# The Basicsâ„¢

This section will cover the very basic concepts required for your Arduino to start interfacing with the outside world. But first: what is a microcontroller? 

## Microcontrollers

As mentioned previously, Arduinos are a family of microcontrollers released by the Arduino coorporation. A **microcontrollers** (or MCU for short) is a tiny computer. Unlike regular computers, MCUs have been designed to only have the bare necessities, making them much weaker in terms of overall performance. 

However, performance is relative; although they can't open up browser windows, their barebones hardware implementation allows them to *respond* and *interact* with the outside world extremely quickly. As such, MCUs are commonly deployed in parts of systems where timing is crucical: robot movement systems, real-time sensor data processing, high-throughput communication (routers, network switches) and etc. 

> The bonus of having less hardware? MCUs are **cheap**.
